# TheProject

repl version : https://replit.com/@IridiumFox/armardaCampaignGenerator

main.py is the main body of code
SWACG.py is the modulke 
mainTK.py getting to grips with TKinter
mainTK2.py working on the map element

once the individual elements are working the plan is to integrate them back together into a single working file

stripper.py is used to remove a reference number from the planet name and export it to a txt for use later. not really required once the names have been done

plan is to make this a standalone exe file(unsure if this will work on anything other than a windows PC at present)
