Armada campaign Generator

Goal of the Project 
A Python programme that creates a campaign environment for group play for the Starwars Armada series of games.  
Audience 

For group of Players of Star Wars Armada seeking a more random campaign environment  

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) 
A text printout in a list format of campaign details and resources

Technology Choices 
The MVP can be done entirely in core Python â€“ no special libraries needed. Could expand MVP(MVP+) time permitting to include a generated map from the campaign details 
Risks 

The official campaigns (The Corellian Conflict and Rebellion in the Rim) have no published rulesets and will have to be reversed engineered from these sets to create a ruleset as a guide 
The product will be niche and will encounter problems in testing the creation tool. To overcome this I would make available a beta copy once MVP+ is achieved(pillow, matplotlib to be research)

Task List 
Create a paper ruleset from the current campaign products as a basis for the creator
Interpret ruleset into creator 

Create a series of functions that link together to generate the data from as little user input as possible
Output the details to a list detailing name, assets, special rules

output to a csv and or html file

MVP eta 2 weeks
MVP+(Map) 2 Additional weeks

Extensions 
Use Lists(possible DB) to allow creation of areas based in the Starwars universe 
Implement map from data created from ruleset 
A means to save/load/print generated campaign environments
Allow user to rename certain assets as required
A GUI to make the game more attractive.
